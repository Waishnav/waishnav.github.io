What is Community Bonding Period?
=================================

Hello readers, I’m Vaishnav, recently got selected for project at CircuitVerse for Google Summer of Code 2024. The Community Bonding Period is spans of several weeks leading up to the official start of coding in GSoC. In this short blog, I’ll sharing some bits around my experience during this period.

How did I spend it?
===================

It started with Google’s official meet and soon after CircuitVerse official introductory meet. In this meet, [Vedant](https://github.com/vedant-jain03) introduced himself and shared his experience of becoming Org Admin from being contributor. Later in the meet every mentor, [Tanmoy](https://github.com/tanmoysrt), [Vaibhav](https://github.com/VaibhavUpreti) and [Prerna](https://github.com/Prerna-0202) shared their own pat year GSoC experience how their skills grew cause of CV community. For me it was truly an inspiring moment, and this was the time I got to know a lot about my mentor. Due to this meet I’m got more hype up about my project since CV culture is so friendly and professional.

Later on we had weekly meets, where we had discussion not only around project but also around software development in general. In the second week, I had very good conversation with [Tanmoy](https://github.com/tanmoysrt) amd he shared his internship experiences at Frappe. He shared helpful insights on approaching a career in software engineering. Also we had all sorts of chats around India colleges and his UG experience.

We also conducted some unofficial meets just among us (GSoC mentee) and discussed each other projects helped each other figure out few workarounds.

One week prior to the start of coding period I had a detailed call with my mentor [Aboobacker](https://github.com/tachyons) and [Tanmoy](https://github.com/tanmoysrt), we had a discussion about the timeline of my project and the order of tasks. My proposed timeline was little bit tweak with their feedbacks.
